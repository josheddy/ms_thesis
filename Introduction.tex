\section{(Personal Motivation)}

I first took an interest in unmanned aircraft in the fall of 2012, my sophomore year of college. In search of an exciting engineering challenge, several of my friends and I founded the Cooperative Autonomous Robotics Design (CARD) team at Virginia Tech. Our core team consisted of a dozen students devoted to designing and competing with drones and other robotic vehicles. Our team, guided by my future graduate adviser Kevin Kochersberger, entered a number of design competitions and brought home several awards for the university. My early experiences with the team brought me into contact with microcontroller programming, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller design, mechatronics, and computer-aided design (CAD) modeling.

After two years of involvement with the CARD team, I applied for an internship at the National Institute of Aerospace\footnote{\url{http://www.nianet.org}} (NIA). In the summer of 2014, I was part of a team of NIA researchers working on the Flying Donkey Challenge\footnote{\url{http://www.flyingdonkey.org}}, an international engineering competition centered around the idea of ``flying donkeys,'' full-sized autonomous airplanes capable of quickly carrying cargo between small airports in rural Africa. This competition, unfortunately now defunct, was divided into a number of sub-challenges focusing on different technical objectives such as precision landing and collision avoidance. Our team's goal was to design an inexpensive system for GPS-denied navigation that could reliably guide unmanned aircraft during a GPS blackout. This project introduced me to many of the technologies and techniques that would later become my major research interests, particularly the Robot Operating System\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org}} (ROS), Kalman filtering, and sensor fusion.

\end{figure}

My internship at the NIA brought me into contact with Dr. Danette Allen, head of the NASA Langley Autonomy Incubator. During the 2014--15 academic year, Dr. Allen sponsored the CARD team to design and build two autonomous multirotor delivery drones. These aircraft were capable of delivering 5-lb packages to distances of up to 2.5 miles (or 5 miles, round trip). In addition, these vehicles were able to land precisely on 1 m$^2$ April tags such as that found in Figure~\ref{fig:april_tag}\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/apriltags\_ros}}. Following the completion of this project, I worked as a summer intern at the Autonomy Incubator.

During the summer of 2015, I began the research that eventually evolved into my thesis project, studying Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) and the unscented Kalman filter. In reading up on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), I took a serious interest in the design of the algorithm. Unlike many other formulations of the Kalman filter, the UKF has a notably limited dependence on information about the system whose state is being estimated (this \textit{system agnosticism} is discussed in detail later on in Chapter~\ref{ch:alg_design}). In learning about the UKF, I became excited by the idea of taking advantage of this trait to build a minimalistic software interface by which a wide variety of disparate systems could one day be tracked and studied in a ROS framework. I envisioned a kind of ``one-stop shopping'' experience for massively reusable and customizable filtering profiles that could fulfill the needs of a great many researchers and roboticists with little overhead in the way of state estimation knowledge. This vision eventually drove my development of the \texttt{kalman\_sense} ROS package and cemented my interest in state estimation and controls.

\section{Organization of this Document}

\subsection*{Prior Work}

In Prior Work, we explore recent contributions to loosely coupled filter-based navigation and estimation. We focus primarily on a number of impactful publications coming from ETH Zurich's Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) and the University of Pennsylvania's GRASP Lab. We define the current state of the art in filter-based navigation and establish the research context in which this work exists.

\subsection*{Algorithm Design and Implementation}

Because of the naturally computational nature of this work, we explore in detail the design and implementation of the \texttt{kalman\_sense} ROS package. We discuss plant model abstraction as well as code organization and data flow. We summarize the process by which one could extend \texttt{kalman\_sense}'s functionality and the advantages of system-agnostic algorithm design.

\subsection*{Experimental Design}

In this section, we first establish the goals of the testing regimen and then discuss the real-world execution of these goals. We discuss important statistical methods for characterizing the system's effectiveness as well as data collection procedures and post-processing. Physical testing infrastructure is explored in detail.

\subsection*{Experimental Results}

In Experimental Results, we evaluate the system's performance during testing and seek out any limiting factors that influence estimation accuracy. We probe for possible improvements to the algorithm and provide a notional understanding of the system's theoretical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

We briefly summarize the contributions made by this work, the effectiveness of the \texttt{kalman\_sense} package, and any miscellaneous insights acquired during programming and testing. 

\subsection*{Future Work}

In Future Work, we expand upon the possible improvements proposed in Experimental Results and also offer a number of applications for this work. Specific examples of heterogeneous fleet management and unmanned traffic management (UTM) are explored.
