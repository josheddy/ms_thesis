\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This work would not have been possible were it not for my graduate adviser and committee chair, Dr.~Kevin Kochersberger. He has been a constant source of support since October 2012 when he agreed to serve as faculty adviser for my undergraduate design team. Since then, Dr.~Kochersberger has guided my work and provided me with numerous opportunities for which I am sincerely grateful.

It is also my pleasure to thank Dr.~Danette Allen of the NASA Langley Autonomy Incubator, who offered me opportunities to intern in her lab and taught me much of what I know today about Kalman filtering. Dr.~Allen supplied me with both funding and equipment in order to perform this research, even going so far as to allow me to use her lab's motion capture facilities for my experiments.

I would also like to thank Dr.~Loc Tran and Mr.~James Neilan of NASA Langley and Ralph Williams of Analytical Mechanics Associates Inc., who collectively provided me with hours of programming guidance. 

Special thanks also go to Samuel Rubenking, who stuck with me to the end. Thanks, Sam.
