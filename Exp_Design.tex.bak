\section{Testing Considerations}

Before venturing further, we should summarize the goals of the UKF framework described previously with particular attention to unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations. This ROS package was designed with the express intent of producing estimates of the position vector $\mathbf{p}$ and orientation quaternion $\mathbf{q}$ of a rotorcraft UAV in real time. Thus, the experiments testing \texttt{kalman\_sense}'s efficacy compare the filter's estimates of position and orientation to the ``ground truth'' as measured by a Vicon\footnote{\url{https://www.vicon.com}} motion capture system.

\section{The Experiments}

The following three experiments were devised to characterize the filter's behavior:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An $x$-directional ``long walk,''
\item A $y$-directional ``long walk,'' and
\item A square pattern translation.
\end{enumerate}
In each experiment, the
