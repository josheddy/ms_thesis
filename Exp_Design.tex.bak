\section{Testing Considerations}

Before venturing further, we now summarize the goals of the UKF framework described previously, paying particular attention to unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations. This ROS package was designed with the express intent of producing estimates of the position vector $\mathbf{p}$ and orientation quaternion $\mathbf{q}$ of a rotorcraft UAV in real time. Thus, the experiments testing the system's efficacy compare the filter's estimates of position and orientation to the ground truth as measured by Vicon.

This system depends upon two sensors: a global-shutter monocular camera and an IMU. The IMU used in this experiment contains a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope. To simulate both sensors moving through the scene in a manner reminiscent of hovering rotorcraft flight, a rolling test stand was constructed to carry the sensors safely throughout a large motion capture environment. Mounting the sensor suite on a large, steady, level platform allows for a high degree of control over the accelerations and angular velocities felt by the IMU, as well as the motion captured by the ventral camera. In order to validate the UKF framework's effectiveness under ideal conditions, a modern laptop computer containing an Intel i7 processor with 16~GB of RAM was used for all computations. The floor of the motion capture environment was strewn with a mixture of April tags and modified Quick Response\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code}} (QR) codes in order to provide sufficient visual features for PTAM to track.

\section{Experimental Procedures}

Two experiments were designed to characterize the UKF framework's effectiveness in various regimes of motion. In the first experiment, the mobile test stand was moved in a rectangular ``box'' pattern at approximately constant speed, without rotation.

In this image, the orange segments are actually composed of arrows pointing along the vehicle's $x$-axis (parallel to the red axis at the origin). The experiment starts one meter above the origin and the cart is pushed in a rectangular pattern, coming to rest at the origin again.}
